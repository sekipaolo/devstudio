2024-07-11T13:42:41.4593392Z       Update the README file to explain the reason why people would want to use a Github Action that uses AWS Bedrock for code changes.

2024-07-11T13:42:41.4595592Z       Based on the repository content and the pull request description, suggest changes to the codebase. 
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4597604Z       Format your response as a series of git commands that can be executed to make the changes.
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4599323Z       Each command should be on a new line and start with 'git'.
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4601552Z       For file content changes, use 'git add' followed by the file path, then provide the new content between <<<EOF and EOF>>> markers.
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4603565Z       Ensure all file paths are valid and use forward slashes.
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4605007Z       Do not suggest changes to this workflow file itself or any GitHub Actions workflows.
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4607262Z       Consider the overall architecture and coding style of the existing codebase when suggesting changes.
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4609435Z       If the pull request description is vague, use your best judgment based on the repository content.
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4611210Z       If no changes are necessary or if the request is unclear, state so explicitly.
2024-07-11T13:42:41.4613193Z       When you have finished suggesting all changes, end your response with the line END_OF_SUGGESTIONS.
